Description: |
    The `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.
    It recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets
    and is able to transliterate files between almost any pair. When exact
    transliteration are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
    characters or fall back on approximations.  Most RFC 1345 character sets
    are supported.
